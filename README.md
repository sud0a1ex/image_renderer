# Image Renderer
This project was only created for fun :)
Feel free to use the code and the project.
## What does this program do?
This program draws pixels on the table to create pixel art by typing colors and using commas.

Here are some examples:

![Example 1](https://github.com/sud0a1ex/image_renderer/blob/master/Images/example_0.png?raw=true "Example 1")
![Example 2](https://github.com/sud0a1ex/image_renderer/blob/master/Images/example_1.png?raw=true "Example 2")
![Example 3](https://github.com/sud0a1ex/image_renderer/blob/master/Images/example_2.png?raw=true "Example 3")

## How to use it?
Set the size of the table(Minimum: 2, Maximum: 64), then set your brush size(Maximum: 20).
To start drawing, you'll have to type in the text box. Using commas to seperate pixels you want to draw with different colors. Also, if you want to skip a pixel, just use the comma and leave a space for that pixel.

Here, I want to draw a simple rectangle with black outline. I'm going to set my table size to 3x3 by typing 3. Set my brush to 1 and start drawing.
Like this:
